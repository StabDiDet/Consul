            The budget lives from your contributions! Tell us what you would like to have implemented - and then share your ideas with others. You can indicate whether you would like to support the implementation yourself or whether the city administration should take responsibility.<br></br>
            You can also make an initial price assessment for your contribution. The city administration will check your contribution for its feasibility and also provide a price estimate. Thank you for taking the time and getting involved!
